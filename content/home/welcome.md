# Symmetry Investments Jobs

<p class="lead">

At Symmetry we believe that man-machine integration is not only the question at the heart of future competitiveness in the markets but also of crucial importance for society as a whole. We are interested in candidates who are inspired and excited by the challenge of participating in developing a new approach at the leading edge.

We are looking for people on both a permanent and contractual basis. We welcome applicants of all backgrounds and levels of experience. Here are a few qualities and traits we value:

* Curiosity
* Extreme motivation
* Mechanical sympathy
* Extreme intellectual capabilities
* A love of tinkering
* Resourcefulness
* Good taste and love of beauty
* Common sense and commercial orientation
* Practical people who are at the same time unreasonable when they ought to be
* Highly individual people oriented to promoting survival and flourishing of the group

We are looking for solution-oriented people who raise problems when they see them, and take the initiative in working with the right people across the firm to solve them. We like people who take a thoughtful approach to problem-solving and are able to tolerate uncertainty until all pieces of a puzzle fall into place.

We support individualists who have an inner need to excel at what they do and are capable of, and also value, collaborative work. We appreciate rare talent that, because of its uniqueness, might be undervalued in a more conventional corporate setting. We value people who can think like entrepreneurs &mdash; as co-owners of the business &mdash; and develop creative solutions to solve our challenges, and who will get their hands dirty, if necessary, in making sure solutions are well executed to generate value for our investors.

Location-wise we have done remote-first before it was cool, so you can work from anywhere. Sponsorship for a visa in one of London, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Jersey is also a possibility. We are also flexible on employment term: full-time, fixed-term contract, or flexible hours are all possibilities to discuss.

Compensation is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards, and the overall package rivals most in flexibility and growth potential. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure &mdash; don't be surprised if our founder and CIO starts asking you questions about your work.

Here are the technology positions we are hiring for:

#### Core Technology

We are always on lookout for __strong software engineers__. Virtues and capabilities are more important to us than just experience and credentials, although those things aren't a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We use the [D programming language](https://dlang.org) but are not looking for good D developers as much as good developers who will learn and use D on the job. You get to choose the programming language for the coding interview. We've recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Julia, and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.

As any technologically-sophisticated firm, we have broad needs for our systems development, which include: __DevOps__, __InfoSec__, __documentation__, __UX__, __process designers__, __team and tool design__, Windows and Linux __desktop support__, __system/server administration__.

### Business Technology

We are looking for strong fintech people in __portfolio research__, __analytics__, __investment research__. Research is carried in our own Symmetry Integration Language, R, Julia, and Python. Such a position is for you if you have strong math and modeling skills, an ability to code, and can collaborate productively with other analysts and with developers.

### General Business

We also have openings in risk, operations, legal, compliance, finance, administrative, organisational design, documentation, internal communication, investor relations processes, contract administration, and data cleaning.
