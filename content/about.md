Symmetry Investments is a post-startup alternative asset management company with about 6.5 billion USD under management. Our 220 people are spread across multiple time zones and locations. Our core technology team has been remote first for some time now, and the whole company is following suit, post-COVID.

We take technology and the culture of the firm very seriously.

We are three years into a period of transformation from initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager. It's not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming but are oriented towards solving their business problems, with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.

The language's interpreter is implemented in the [D language](https://dlang.org), we hosted [DConf](https://dconf.org) in 2019 and again in 2020. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the infrastructure (build system, continuous integration, and such).

It's quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it's commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.
